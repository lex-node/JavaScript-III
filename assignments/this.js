/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. When "this" is globally scoped, "this" refers to the uber-Object, the form of forms, the great prototype of prototypes
* 2. When "this" is used within the method of an object, and then that method is called on that object, "this" refers to that object.
* 3. When "this" is used within a constructor, calling that constructor makes "this" refer to the specific instance of the class that is created by that call.
* 4. Using "call" or "apply" together with a parameter can override  "this"'s default application to a constructed instance in favor of applying to a different constructed instance. 
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
